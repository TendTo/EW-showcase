    "SECTION_3_TEXT": "The main role of the EWC is to ensure that there is consensus on the data and that all applications and smart contracts behave in a deterministic manner.\nIt is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and as such allows the creation of smart contracts and respects all the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC).\nThere is also a test-net, called Volta, used to test projects and applications before running on the main-net.\nThe consensus algorithm is Proof of Authority (POA), based on the AuRA protocol. At the cost of less decentralization, it ensures very high performance.\nThe token used on the blockchain is called Energy Web Token (EWT).",
    "SECTION_4_TEXT": "The utility layer consists of a set of EWC-based services that aim to make the entire infrastructure as accessible and inviting as possible for developers.\nAll services are paid for in EWT.\nThree broad categories of services are identified: End-user experience, Multi-platform interoperability, Application performance.\n\nSome examples are:",

    "SECTION_5_TEXT": "Set of frameworks and services designed to create decentralized applications on EW-DOS.\n\nThere are two main examples:\nEW-Origin - Used to develop applications that support the tracking, transmission and awarding of energy Attribute Certificates (EAC) according to industry standards.\nEW-Flex - Open source software for the management of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) and the operations that involve them. Ensures an easy connection to the network, submitting the offers coming from small producers to an authorized operator that acts as intermetiator between the user and the grid."

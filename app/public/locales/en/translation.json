The DID document contains all the informations or claims related to the subject the DID identifies and provides a set of mechanisms which enable a DID controller to prove its control over the DID. They also typically express verification methods, such as cryptographic public keys, and services relevant to interactions with the DID subject.\n\nThe controller of a DID is the entity that has the capability to make changes to a DID document. This capability is typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys.\nNote that a DID might have more than one controller, and the DID subject can be the DID controller, or one of them.\n\nSystems that support recording DIDs and returning data necessary to produce DID documents are called a verifiable data registry.\nA DID resolver is the component responsible of returning the correct DID document given its DID.

This is achieved through DIDAuth.\nThis process can take many forms, as specified in the DID document, but a common way is through a challenge sent by the issuer or the verifier to the subject, whose public key they know thanks to the DID document, which in turn will respond by signing with the its private key, proving its identity.\n\nLet's try a real world analogy.\nYou want to buy alcohol at a bar. To do so, you must be able to prove to the barman that you are at least 18 years old. The barman in this case is the verifier.\nYou can prove your claim by showing your identity card. \nIt is issued from the government, which acts as a trusted issuer for the barman, who will check that you are actually the person pictured in the photo and will be convinced that you are old enough.",

Additionally, the cryptographic proofs contained in the transactions allow the offline verification of the data.\nThis is why all the permissions are anchored on-chain and the description of roles are held in an ENS smart-contract.</p>\n\n<h5>Information about users and roles must be confidential.</h5>\n<p>In the Energy Web solution, no third party has the full list of users of an application. \nThis is guaranteed by the permission-granting process, for is the user who stores the claim and anchors it on chain, allowing them to prove they have been granted a certain privilege.\nAlso, because it is a private claim, the contents are provable but not disclosed.\nThe only information an observer can garner is that the user has added a claim to their DID document but not the content, origin, or nature of the claim.</p>\n<fig></fig>\n\n<h5>Finally, it must leverage a decentralized infrastructure.</h5>\n<p>This is achieved by using a combination of the Energy Web blockchain and <a>IPFS</a>, which are both peer networks.\nAn additional layer will make the IAM management even easier: a messaging service that will be provided by the service nodes of the EW-DOS.\nEach message will be signed by the sender, to avoid any malicious alteration.</p>",

You can enroll with your DID to both roles.\nApplications to the former need approval from a specific DID, while for the latter anyone with a \"testrole\" role can approve the request.\nRoles can have optional fields containing an arbitrary amount of data of different types.\n\nThere is also an app called \"TESTAPP\" associated with the organization, and it contains has a role, namely the \"juniordev\" role.\n\nThis kind of hierarchy ensures a fine control and flexibility over permissions whithn an organization."
